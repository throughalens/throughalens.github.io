            You lift the ball over your head, tossing it with the little force your tiny arms can muster.
        </h1>

        <p id="intro">
            The ball follows a short arc, bouncing on the grass before rolling up to Scrungus' feet. You keep playing catch and enjoy the rest of your summer.
            The next year, the wizard that cursed you is struck and killed by a familiar Cybertruck in Chicken Bristle, Illinois.
            You're returned to your adult body, and are promptly kicked out by your parents.
            In twenty years time, you're still working an entry-level desk job with the promise of upward mobility.
            Scrungus becomes a Supreme Court justice.
        </p>

        <p id="theEnd">
            THE END.
        </p>
