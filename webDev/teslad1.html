            You run out into the street and are struck by a passing CYBERTRUCK.
        </h1>

        <p id="intro">
            Its silent electric motors gave you no warning, and its faulty self-driving tech doesn't detect your child-sized body, which crumples like paper under the stainless steel chassis (VERY STREET LEGAL).
            The tragedy will be discussed ad nauseum on Twitter, where Elon will like original memes mocking your death before stealing their jokes to post for himself.
            Your blood paints the road to Tesla's future.
        </p>
        <p id="theEnd">
            THE END.
        </p>
